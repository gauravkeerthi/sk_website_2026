      plan are subject to change at any time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Refunds will not be issued except in cases of accidental charges. If you believe you

        committed subscription term.</li>
      <li><strong>Auto-renewal:</strong> Subscriptions may auto-renew based on the selected plan. Users will receive
        advance notification prior to their subscription renewal, with the notice period varying according to their

        current subscription period.</li>
      <li><strong>Taxes and transaction fees:</strong> We do not currently impose separate taxes or transaction fees, as
        these are included in the stated price. Please note, however, that this may change at our sole discretion and
        without prior notice, in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, or changes in tax treatment. To the
        extent applicable, the Customer remains responsible for the payment of taxes or transaction fees.</li>

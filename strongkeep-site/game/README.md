# Knight Dreams - 404 Easter Egg

A fun mini-game to brighten up our 404 error pages.

## About

This is a fork of [Knight Dreams](https://github.com/js13kGames/knight-dreams), originally created for the js13kGames competition. We've adapted it to serve as an entertaining easter egg for users who land on our 404 pages.

## Purpose

Instead of showing users a boring "Page Not Found" message, we give them something fun to play while they're here. It's a small way to turn a frustrating moment into a pleasant surprise. Works on desktop and mobile (not ideal).

## Credits

Original game by the [js13kGames/knight-dreams](https://github.com/js13kGames/knight-dreams) team.

## Usage

Include this game on your 404 error pages to give users a delightful distraction.

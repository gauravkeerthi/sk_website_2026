      For most SMBs in 2025, that box is the wrong bet. A DNS firewall, paired with strong endpoint and identity

    <h2>First, what is a Firewall and how is a DNS Firewall different?</h2>
    <p>A traditional hardware firewall sits at the edge of your network and inspects <strong>all incoming and outgoing
        data</strong>, deciding what to allow or block based on complex rules. Because it processes every packet, it
      requires <strong>careful setup</strong>, regular maintenance, and can <strong>slow down network
        traffic</strong>—and if the device fails or misconfigurations occur, it can <strong>block the entire
        company</strong> from accessing the internet.</p>
    <p>In contrast, a DNS firewall works at the level of <strong>domain lookups</strong>, blocking malicious links
      <em>before</em> any connection is made. It does not inspect or process all data, so it stays
      <strong>fast</strong>, lightweight, and extremely easy to deploy—often just by changing DNS settings or installing
      a small agent. Despite its simplicity, a DNS firewall is highly effective at stopping phishing links, malware
      sites, and command-and-control domains without the operational complexity of a hardware firewall.</p>

    <h2>1) Hardware firewalls demand care you will not consistently give</h2>
    <p>A modern firewall is not a smoke detector. It needs frequent updates, rule hygiene, log reviews, certificate
      care, and the occasional firmware dance that brings down the office at 7 p.m. on a Wednesday. That rhythm is fine
      for a full-time network team. It is unrealistic for a five-to-fifty person company where the "IT department" is
      one overworked generalist or an external vendor who drops by once a month.</p>
    <p>DNS firewalls flip that equation. There is no on-prem box to babysit. Protection is delivered as a cloud service.
      Policies are managed centrally in a browser. The burden shifts from hands-on device maintenance to light-touch
      policy administration. In other words, you trade a high-maintenance control for a low-maintenance control that
      still blocks the nasties you see most often. For SMBs, that operational simplicity is not a luxury. It is the
      difference between a control that actually works and a control that quietly decays.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="article-section animate-on-scroll">
    <h2>2) Hardware firewalls do not match how your people actually work</h2>
    <p>Traditional firewall thinking assumes your staff sit behind the office perimeter and tunnel back in with a VPN.
      That is not your reality. Your team lives in Google Workspace or Microsoft 365, shares files in chat apps, joins
      video calls from home, and answers emails on personal phones. Many dislike the friction of a VPN and do not use it
      unless required.</p>
    <p>A DNS firewall follows the person rather than the place. Whether a risky link arrives by email, WhatsApp, a QR
      code, or a browser search, the protection travels with the user and applies on any network, including home Wi-Fi
      and coffee shop hotspots. That is a better match for remote and hybrid work. When protection aligns with daily
      habits, it gets used. When it depends on staff remembering to switch on a VPN, it often does not.</p>

  <section class="article-section animate-on-scroll">
    <h2>3) DNS firewalls block the biggest real-world threat: malicious destinations</h2>
    <p>Most successful attacks against small businesses do not start with James-Bond-level intrusions. They begin with
      social engineering and a malicious destination. Click the fake invoice. Reset your password on a look-alike site.
      Authorise a dodgy app that steals your mail. These attacks all rely on a device reaching out to a domain that
      should never resolve.</p>
    <p>A DNS firewall cuts that journey at the first step. If the domain is known to be malicious or newly registered in
      a suspicious way, it never resolves and the connection fails. You break the kill chain before anything downloads
      or executes. Is a hardware firewall "more capable" at deep packet inspection? Possibly, and that matters in
      specialised environments. For the majority of day-to-day threats an SMB actually encounters, stopping the
      destination is both fast and effective.</p>

  <section class="article-section animate-on-scroll">
    <h2>4) Fewer network devices means a smaller attack surface and fewer outages</h2>
    <p>Here is the irony. The hardware you buy to protect yourself <a
        href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-26/hacking-campaign-has-breached-cisco-devices-in-us-government"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">can become your weakest link</a>. Attackers love internet-facing infrastructure
      that is rarely patched on time. Routers, firewalls, and VPN concentrators are routinely targeted because a single
      flaw can compromise an entire network. If that device fails or a firmware update goes wrong, the whole office
      grinds to a halt.</p>
    <p>Moving protection to DNS reduces this risk. You remove a highly targeted on-prem appliance from your stack. You
      also reduce the chance that SSL inspection on an undersized box will break modern apps or cause mysterious
      slowness. The result is a smaller attack surface and a happier helpdesk. Your team notices when Zoom stutters or
      the CRM times out. They do not notice when a malicious domain quietly fails to resolve. In security, invisible and
      reliable is a win.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="article-section animate-on-scroll">
    <h2>5) Better economics and a better user experience</h2>
    <p>Small businesses do not just need security. They need security that fits the budget and does not slow anyone
      down. Hardware firewalls carry two costs. There is the visible line item for the box and its annual subscription.
      Then there is the invisible cost of time spent tuning rules, chasing certificate issues, troubleshooting broken
      websites, and scheduling disruptive updates.</p>
    <p>A DNS firewall shifts you to a predictable subscription that scales by user or device, with almost no local
      maintenance. Because decisions happen at the domain layer, performance hits are minimal and breakage is rare.
      Staff do not lodge tickets about slow browsing or blocked mobile apps. Finance does not complain about surprise
      upgrade cycles. Executives do not wonder why the office internet went down during a firmware push. You get fewer
      headaches and a cleaner TCO story without compromising on the protection that matters most to you.</p>
    <p>As a simple cost comparison for a company of 15 staff:</p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li>A <strong>traditional hardware firewall + VPN</strong> start at S$1500 for the hardware, with added annual
        software (VPN) and maintenance support costs (usually about S$800/year)</li>
      <li>A <strong>next-gen hardware firewall + VPN</strong> will cost about S$2500 for hardware, with the same added
        costs.</li>
      <li>A <strong>DNS firewall</strong> has no hardware cost, and maintenance is included in the service. It will cost
        about S$450/year (if you get it separately)</li>
      <li><strong>StrongKeep customers</strong> are able to access a bundled EDR (sophisticated AI-based anti-malware
        protection for the device) and the DNS firewall at just S$5/month/device, which lowers the overall cost of
        adding DNS firewall protection to your company.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="article-section animate-on-scroll">
    <h2>DNS Firewalls are for SMBs, not Enterprise needs</h2>
    <p>DNS control is not network segmentation, and it does not see everything. Two practical gaps follow from that.</p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li><strong>First, segmentation.</strong> If you have on-prem servers, point-of-sale devices, CCTV, or operational
        technology that should never talk to each other, a DNS firewall will not create those walls for you. You still
        need to separate traffic with simple VLANs, SD-WAN, or a virtual or cloud firewall in front of sensitive
        services. Without segmentation, a compromised device can move laterally more easily.</li>
      <li><strong>Second, visibility and bypass.</strong> Some applications hard-code DNS, use encrypted DNS to public
        resolvers, or talk directly to IP addresses over protocols that a DNS layer cannot observe. This is not a deal
        breaker, but it is a reason to pair DNS filtering with modern endpoint protection. The endpoint can watch
        outbound connections, stop malicious processes, and quarantine a host if something slips through. If you operate
        in a regulated environment that specifies a boundary appliance, you may need to meet that requirement with a
        cloud-managed or virtual option rather than a physical box.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="article-section animate-on-scroll">
    <h2>Conclusion: spend where it changes outcomes</h2>
    <p>Security that only works on paper does not serve a small business. A hardware firewall looks serious, but it asks
      for constant care, sits in the wrong place for a remote workforce, and often becomes another problem to manage. A
      DNS firewall meets the moment. It blocks the destinations that fuel the majority of incidents, follows your people
      wherever they work, shrinks your attack surface, and replaces operational toil with a simple policy.</p>
    <p>If you run specialised workloads, host sensitive on-prem systems, or must satisfy a control that truly requires a
      boundary device, make that investment with eyes open and keep the ruleset tight. For everyone else, skip the box.
      Put your money into DNS filtering, strong endpoints, and identity controls that keep your team safe without
      getting in their way. You will not just save on hardware. You will save on stress, downtime, and the everyday
      friction that makes people look for shortcuts. That is what practical cyber for small businesses should feel like.
    </p>
    <p>At StrongKeep, we have built cybersecurity that makes sense for smaller businesses, that is simpler to use,
      effectively keeps you secure, and is way more affordable than the enterprise stuff that other vendors are pushing
      on to you. Keep yourself secure (on a budget), with StrongKeep.</p>

    <h2>The Cyber Inequity Challenge</h2>
    <p>Gaurav Keerthi, CEO and founder of security start-up StrongKeep, said this threat landscape has led to what the World Economic Forum calls "cyber inequity," in which large enterprises remain well protected, while smaller ones lag behind in cyber readiness.</p>

    <div class="article-quote">
      <p>"Cybersecurity is unequally distributed. Big enterprises have a lot of it. Small enterprises have none of it. And to some extent, it's a little bit unfair, but they become the targets because the attackers are trying to get after your company through them."</p>

    <h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
    <p>In this video interview with Information Security Media Group at the <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.asia/govware-c-931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GovWare Conference and Exhibition 2025</a>, Keerthi discussed:</p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li><strong>Governance and procurement controls:</strong> Why these can effectively mitigate third-party risk</li>
      <li><strong>Expanding resilience frameworks:</strong> How resilience frameworks are expanding beyond technology</li>
      <li><strong>Enterprise collaboration:</strong> The importance of collaboration to strengthen the overall cyber landscape</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="article-section animate-on-scroll">
    <h2>Third-Party Risk</h2>
    <p>With organizations increasingly relying on vendors, cloud providers, and open-source tools, the attack surface has expanded dramatically. Threat actors are constantly finding new ways to compromise enterprises through their supply chain relationships.</p>
    <p>Smaller firms become attractive targets for attackers seeking entry into larger organizations. By compromising a vendor with weaker defenses, attackers can gain access to larger, better-protected organizations — making cybersecurity a collective challenge.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="article-section animate-on-scroll">
    <h2>The Path Forward</h2>
    <p>True resilience extends beyond technology solutions. It requires building security awareness, establishing clear processes, and creating a culture where cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility.</p>
    <p>Enterprise collaboration is essential to improve the overall cyber landscape. Larger organizations can support smaller partners through shared resources, training, and accessible security frameworks.</p>

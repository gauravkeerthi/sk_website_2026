    <p class="article-lead">39 per cent of small businesses in Singapore report losses or disruptions due to cyberattacks in 2024 — yet many lack dedicated security teams. If you're an IT manager stretched thin, this guide is for you.</p>

    <h2>The Reality of SMB Security</h2>
    <p>IT managers in small and medium-sized businesses are often expected to handle cybersecurity alongside their other duties. Without a dedicated security team, achieving perfect security is impossible.</p>
    <p>The goal isn't perfection — it's implementing "minimum viable cybersecurity" by focusing on essentials, documentation, and insurance coverage.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="article-section animate-on-scroll">
    <h2>Strategy 1: Get the Cyber Essentials Mark</h2>
    <p>The Cyber Essentials Mark (CEM) is a foundational certification from Singapore's Cyber Security Agency. It covers the essential bases:</p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li><strong>User account security:</strong> Proper access controls and authentication</li>
      <li><strong>Data backups:</strong> Regular, tested backup procedures</li>
      <li><strong>System updates:</strong> Keeping software current</li>
      <li><strong>Endpoint protection:</strong> Antivirus and anti-malware</li>
      <li><strong>Staff training:</strong> Security awareness for employees</li>
      <li><strong>Incident response planning:</strong> What to do when things go wrong</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This certification provides a recognized framework that demonstrates due diligence.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="article-section animate-on-scroll">
    <h2>Strategy 2: Document Everything</h2>
    <p>Creating thorough records is your best defense if something goes wrong. Documentation provides defensible evidence of reasonable professional action:</p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li><strong>Security controls:</strong> What measures are in place</li>
      <li><strong>Risks identified:</strong> What threats were considered</li>
      <li><strong>Decisions made:</strong> Why certain approaches were chosen</li>
      <li><strong>Management approvals:</strong> Who signed off on what</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If an incident occurs, this documentation shows you acted responsibly with the resources available.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="article-section animate-on-scroll">
    <h2>Strategy 3: Get Cyber Insurance</h2>
    <p>Cyber insurance acts as a critical safety net for financial recovery after breaches or attacks. However, insurers typically require proof of adequate security measures already in place.</p>
    <p>This creates a virtuous cycle: implementing security controls qualifies you for insurance, and having insurance provides peace of mind that allows you to focus on prevention rather than constant worry.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="article-section animate-on-scroll">
    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>You can't prevent every attack, but you can demonstrate that you took reasonable precautions. With Cyber Essentials certification, proper documentation, and cyber insurance, you've done your due diligence.</p>
    <p>That's how you cover your ass — and protect your business.</p>

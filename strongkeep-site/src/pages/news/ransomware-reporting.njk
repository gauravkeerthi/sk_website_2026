    <h2>The Uncomfortable Reality</h2>
    <p>When SMEs experience ransomware attacks, they often approach authorities expecting immediate solutions. However, the reality is far more challenging than most victims anticipate.</p>
    <p>This reality check is difficult for businesses already in crisis mode. The expectation that someone can simply reverse the damage often leads to disappointment and delays in taking appropriate action.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="article-section animate-on-scroll">
    <h2>Survival Comes First</h2>
    <p>When a business is under attack, priorities become very clear very quickly. Victims focus on restoring operations rather than filing reports or answering questions from investigators.</p>
    <p>This highlights a fundamental tension between the immediate operational needs of affected organizations and broader reporting obligations that regulatory frameworks might impose.</p>

  <section class="article-section animate-on-scroll">
    <h2>The Reporting Dilemma</h2>
    <p>Should insurers be compelled to report ransomware incidents? The question raises important considerations:</p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li><strong>Data collection:</strong> Better incident data could help the broader ecosystem understand and respond to threats</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy concerns:</strong> Victims may face additional exposure and reputational damage</li>
      <li><strong>Timing challenges:</strong> Reporting during crisis adds burden to already overwhelmed teams</li>
      <li><strong>Trust implications:</strong> Mandatory reporting may discourage insurance claims or honest disclosure</li>
    </ul>

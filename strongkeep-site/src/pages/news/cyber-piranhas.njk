      <p>"In cybersecurity, it should be clear when government is helping a victim company recover from a devastating attack, and when they are imposing penalties for insufficient prevention. This tension is often the hardest to manage."</p>
      <cite>— Gaurav Keerthi, CEO of StrongKeep</cite>

    <h2>Clear Rules of Engagement</h2>
    <p>Managing the tension between state interests and commercial incentives requires:</p>
    <ul class="article-list">
      <li><strong>Transparent expectations:</strong> Clear communication about what's required from all parties</li>
      <li><strong>Measurable responsibilities:</strong> Defined roles and accountabilities that can be tracked</li>
      <li><strong>Mutual accountability:</strong> Both government and businesses held to their commitments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Partnership Is No Longer Optional</h2>
    <p>While state interests and commercial incentives don't always align, partnership is no longer optional — it's the fundamental requirement for security in today's threat landscape.</p>
    <p>The cyber threats we face today are too sophisticated and too pervasive for any single entity to address alone. Governments have the intelligence and regulatory authority, while commercial entities have the technical expertise and operational visibility. Together, these uncomfortable alliances become the only viable defense.</p>

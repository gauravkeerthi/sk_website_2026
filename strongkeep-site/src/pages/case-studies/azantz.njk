    <p>A new cybersecurity requirement landed after this firm had already won the contract. Like most small businesses,
      they weren't staffed for compliance (and they shouldn't have to be). See how StrongKeep turned an unfamiliar
      certification into a clear, step-by-step path to completion, helping them get certified in just 8 days!</p>

  <!-- The Problem -->
  <section class="case-study-section animate-on-scroll">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>After winning an important project, AZAntz was required to obtain Cyber Essentials certification within a short
      post-award window. This was a new requirement that had not existed in earlier contracts.</p>

    <div class="case-study-quote">
      <p>"I need to meet this new cybersecurity requirement quickly, so I don't lose a government contract — without
        dealing with complicated IT stuff or managing consultants."</p>
    </div>

    <p>While the team understood why this customer was raising cybersecurity standards given the sensitivity of
      government data, their sales team worried that achieving cybersecurity compliance on such short notice would be
      impossible. AZAntz did not have an in-house IT team, and cybersecurity was unfamiliar territory.</p>

    <p>Initially, AZAntz sought help from an external advisor. Progress stalled as the advisor had other ongoing
      commitments. As the deadline loomed and reminders piled up, the team worried they might lose the contract they'd
      just won. It became clear that AZAntz needed a more reliable and structured way to move forward.</p>

    <p>Chee Keong, their Sales Manager, was introduced to StrongKeep.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- The Solution -->
  <section class="case-study-section animate-on-scroll">
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>StrongKeep provided AZAntz with a structured, guided path to compliance, covering both what needed to be done and
      how to do it.</p>

    <div class="case-study-quote">
      <p>"My research showed it would cost a few thousand dollars just for the compliance process, even before buying
        the security tools we'd need. With StrongKeep's plan at $159 a month, we got both the compliance and the tools
        in one package."</p>
    </div>

    <p>Instead of relying on ad-hoc consulting sessions, AZAntz used StrongKeep's compliance platform to follow a clear
      step-by-step checklist that showed exactly what evidence auditors would require. The platform included pre-written
      policies that just needed company details filled in, eliminating weeks of drafting work. Built-in security tools
      were already configured and ready to use, removing the need to research and purchase separate solutions.</p>

    <p>For Chee Keong, the turning point came when he saw how structured the process was.</p>

    <div class="case-study-quote">
      <p>"When I saw the compliance module and the step-by-step list, I knew this was something I could follow.
        Everything was already laid out. I just needed to go through it."</p>
    </div>

    <p>Because the process was built into the platform, AZAntz could move forward independently and at speed, without
      waiting on consultant availability, while still having support when needed.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- The Outcome -->
  <section class="case-study-section animate-on-scroll">
    <h2>The Outcome</h2>
    <p>Using StrongKeep, AZAntz went from no formal cybersecurity measures in place to submitting their Cyber Essentials
      application in just 8 working days!</p>

    <p>What typically takes weeks or months with traditional consulting approaches was completed faster, with less
      money, and less stress. After the application was submitted on day-8, the certifying body arranged a follow-up
      interview. StrongKeep's platform had already guided AZAntz through the questions and evidence required, giving
      Chee Keong the confidence to walk through the interview knowing his answers and documentation were prepared.</p>

    <div class="case-study-quote">
      <p>"When the certifying body scheduled the interview, I wasn't worried. The platform had already walked me through
        the questions and evidence required. There were no surprises. I just explained what we'd already done."</p>
    </div>

    <p>With Cyber Essentials completed ahead of their customer's timeline, AZAntz retained the important contract and
      can now focus on their normal operations, confident that they have a practical framework in place to meet
      additional cybersecurity requirements if and when they come up.</p>

    <h1 class="animate-on-scroll">Compliance without <small><i>complexity, consultants, or costs</i></small>
    </h1>
    <p class="animate-on-scroll">You have to get compliance soon. Whether it's for regulation, contracts, or customer
      trust, you're expected to "just get it done." But the requirements are confusing, the paperwork is heavy, and
      hiring consultants feels expensive and slow.</p>
    <p class="animate-on-scroll">You want to pass... without turning compliance into a full-time job.</p>

    <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">When compliance isn't your job, but the risk is still yours</h2>
    <div class="objections-grid">
      <div class="objection-card animate-on-scroll">
        <h3>Does compliance matter, but it was never meant to be your job?</h3>
        <p>You know compliance matters, but it's not even what you're hired to do! Suddenly, you're handling all the
          policies, evidence, and answers about cyber... The issue isn't effort, it's that no one ever showed small
          businesses how to do this properly.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="objection-card animate-on-scroll">
        <h3>Do you feel uncertain because everything is scattered?</h3>
        <p>You're willing to put in the work, but the uncertainty is exhausting. You don't know what's mandatory,
          what's optional, or how much detail is required. Templates feel generic, consultants feel expensive, and
          uncertainty drags everything out.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="objection-card animate-on-scroll">
        <h3>Do you just want to pass, without becoming a compliance expert?</h3>
        <p>You don't want to specialise in compliance or spend months figuring it out. You just want a clear way to
          achieve "passed", without the endless back-and-forth. Compliance shouldn't feel like a maze, it should feel
          like a checklist you can complete confidently.</p>

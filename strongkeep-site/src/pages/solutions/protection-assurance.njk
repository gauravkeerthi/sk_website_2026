<!-- CHALLENGES -->
<section class="solutions-challenges">
  <div class="solutions-challenges-container">
    <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">The quiet stress behind "Are we actually protected?"</h2>
    <div class="objections-grid">
      <div class="objection-card animate-on-scroll">
        <h3>Does security matter but just never feels urgent enough?</h3>
        <p>You know security matters, but it's hard to prioritise when you're juggling daily work. With a few basics in
          place, it's still unclear whether you're properly protected or just doing what you can. That lack of
          certainty makes security easy to postpone.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="objection-card animate-on-scroll">
        <h3>Do you feel uncertain because everything is scattered?</h3>
        <p>You've put tools in place, but everything lives in different systems. Each shows a small part of the
          picture, leaving you to connect the dots and hope nothing is missed. That ongoing uncertainty is tiring and
          makes cybersecurity feel uneasy instead of reassuring.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="objection-card animate-on-scroll">
        <h3>Do you just want the assurance, without becoming expert?</h3>
        <p>You don't want to manage security full-time or learn complex tools. You just want confidence that risks are
          handled, issues are visible, and protection is working quietly in the background without adding to your
          workload.</p>

<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
<section class="features-list">
  <h2 class="solutions-section-title animate-on-scroll">Here's what real protection assurance looks like</h2>

  <!-- Feature 1 -->
  <div class="feature-section" id="malware-protection">
    <div class="feature-content animate-on-scroll">
      <h3>Protect every device against malware that can disrupt work</h3>
      <p class="feature-description">Roll out malware protection consistently across all staff devices, so nothing is
        left to chance. You can see which devices are protected, which aren't, and what's actively being blocked
        without chasing people or guessing.</p>
      <ul class="feature-points">
        <li>Threats stopped automatically in the background</li>
        <li>Work carries on without disruption</li>
        <li>Clear visibility into what's protected</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="feature-visual animate-on-scroll">
      <img src="/assets/images/solutions/all-devices.avif" alt="All devices protected" loading="lazy">
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Feature 2 -->
  <div class="feature-section reverse" id="phishing-blocking">
    <div class="feature-content animate-on-scroll">
      <h3>Block phishing and scam links before staff accidentally click them</h3>
      <p class="feature-description">Add an extra layer of protection that blocks known phishing and scam links before
        they can even load. Risky websites are stopped in real time, reducing the chance of mistakes slipping through.
      </p>
      <ul class="feature-points">
        <li>Visibility when something is blocked</li>
        <li>Confidence that threats are actively handled</li>
        <li>Protection works without staff intervention</li>
      </ul>

  </div>

  <!-- Feature 3 -->
  <div class="feature-section" id="security-training">
    <div class="feature-content animate-on-scroll">
      <h3>Build safer habits through regular, practical security training</h3>
      <p class="feature-description">Your staff need short, relevant training that fits naturally into busy workdays so
        they learn what to look out for and how to respond. You get clear visibility into who has completed training
        and where gaps remain.</p>
      <ul class="feature-points">
        <li>Stronger habits with less chasing</li>
        <li>Fewer reminders and minimal follow-ups</li>
        <li>Training fits into the workday naturally</li>
      </ul>

  <!-- Feature 4 -->
  <div class="feature-section reverse" id="unified-dashboard">
    <div class="feature-content animate-on-scroll">
      <h3>Manage everything from one dashboard</h3>
      <p class="feature-description">Password security, device protection, and staff management are brought together in
        a single dashboard, so you're not jumping between tools. You can quickly see what's set up, what needs
        attention, and where risks might exist.</p>
      <ul class="feature-points">
        <li>No more jumping between tools</li>
        <li>Clear, reliable view of overall protection</li>
        <li>See what needs attention at a glance</li>

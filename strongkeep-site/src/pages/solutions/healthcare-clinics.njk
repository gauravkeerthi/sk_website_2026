    <h1 class="animate-on-scroll">Compliance that <small><i>stays out of the way </i></small> of patient care</h1>
    <p class="animate-on-scroll">You run a clinic. Your priority is patient care, not cybersecurity paperwork. But new
      regulatory requirements mean you're now expected to prove how patient data is protected.</p>
    <p class="animate-on-scroll">You don't have an IT team, and you don't want consultants slowing you down. You just
      need to pass compliance properly, calmly, and on time.</p>

      <div class="objection-card animate-on-scroll">
        <h3>Expectations feel onerous, but execution is unclear?</h3>
        <p>You know protecting patient information matters, and the regulations state what's expected. But when it comes
          to actually meeting those requirements, it isn't clear. You're asked about policies, access, training, and
          evidence without a practical guide that fits how small clinics really operate.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="objection-card animate-on-scroll">
        <h3>Clinic life leaves little room for complexity?</h3>
        <p>You're balancing patient care, shared computers, tight schedules, and staff wearing multiple hats. There's no
          time for long projects, complex systems, or months of back-and-forth with consultants. Compliance has to fit
          into daily clinic life, not disrupt care or slow everything down.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="objection-card animate-on-scroll">
        <h3>Want assurance beyond your CMS?</h3>
        <p>You trust your Clinic Management System, but responsibility doesn't stop there. Clinics are still accountable
          for staff devices, passwords, email use, Wi-Fi, and training. You want confidence that these everyday risks
          are covered properly, without overhauling how your clinic runs.</p>

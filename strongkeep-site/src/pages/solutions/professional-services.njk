    <p class="animate-on-scroll">You're running a professional services firm, not an IT department. Maybe you don't
      have dedicated IT at all, or your "IT team" is one person juggling everything else.</p>
    <p class="animate-on-scroll">You still want basic cybersecurity in place—without managing multiple tools, learning
      technical jargon, or spending your days worrying if something's been missed.</p>

    <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">The quiet pressure behind protecting client trust</h2>

      <div class="objection-card animate-on-scroll">
        <h3>Does security matter, but you don't have IT capacity to spare?</h3>
        <p>You know protecting client data matters, but security often lands on non-technical staff or a solo IT
          manager. With limited time and no dedicated team, it's hard to give cybersecurity constant attention. That
          lack of capacity makes security feel like another responsibility competing with real work.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="objection-card animate-on-scroll">
        <h3>Does your team work across email, documents, and remote access?</h3>
        <p>Your team relies on email, shared drives, and remote access to get work done. Laptops move between offices
          and client sites, links get clicked, and passwords get reused. These realities create risk—not through
          carelessness, but through normal work happening at speed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="objection-card animate-on-scroll">
        <h3>Do you want confidence without managing complexity?</h3>
        <p>You don't want to build a perfect security setup or manage multiple tools. You just want confidence that the
          basics are handled, risks are visible, and protection is working quietly. Cybersecurity should feel
          predictable and controlled, not like another system you have to babysit.</p>

  <!-- Feature 1 -->
  <div class="feature-section" id="device-protection">
    <div class="feature-content animate-on-scroll">
      <h3>Put essential protection in place across all staff devices</h3>
      <p class="feature-description">Roll out baseline security consistently across laptops and desktops, so nothing is
        left exposed. You can see which devices are protected and which need attention, without chasing people or
        relying on assumptions.</p>
      <ul class="feature-points">
        <li>Protection runs quietly in the background</li>
        <li>Staff can work as usual without added friction</li>

      <h3>Build safer habits with simple staff training</h3>

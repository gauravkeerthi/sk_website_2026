        <h3>Does cybersecurity matter, but feel too daunting to start?</h3>
        <p>You know cybersecurity matters, but it feels large and undefined. You hear about tools, policies, training,
          and threats, yet it's unclear where to begin. Without a clear starting point, the whole matter feels
          overwhelming instead of manageable.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="objection-card animate-on-scroll">
        <h3>Do you feel stuck because there's no clear direction?</h3>
        <p>You want to take action but figuring out what to do first is the hardest part. You don't want to buy the
          wrong tools or invest energy and time without reducing real risk. That uncertainty makes it hard to move
          forward confidently.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="objection-card animate-on-scroll">
        <h3>Do you just want progress, without needing perfection?</h3>
        <p>You're running a business, not building a perfect security system. You want reassurance that you're taking
          the right first steps, reducing risks, and moving forward sensibly. Starting cybersecurity should feel like
          progress, not pressure.</p>

    <h3>Statement of Purpose</h3>
    <p>At StrongKeep Cybersecurity ("<strong>StrongKeep</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>",

      or process personal data. Our systems are purposefully designed to actively minimize and restrict the collection
      of personal information.</p>
    <p>Where the collection of personal data is unavoidable, it is strictly limited to what is necessary for business
      and legal purposes.</p>
    <p>We are committed to transparency and accountability in all our data handling practices, ensuring that your trust
      and security remain central to everything we do. StrongKeep fully complies with all applicable Singapore data

    <h2>Personal Data</h2>
    <p>StrongKeep does not seek to collect or process Personal Data.</p>
    <p>For the purposes of this Statement, "Personal Data" refers to any information, whether true or not, about an
      individual who can be identified:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Directly from that data; or</li>
      <li>From that data and other information to which we have or are likely to have access.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples of Personal Data include an individual's identification number, home address, personal mobile phone
      number, personal photographs and video images, and biometric data such as fingerprints or iris scans.</p>
    <p>Our systems are specifically designed to minimize and limit the intake of Personal Data. Where the collection or
      processing of Personal Data is unavoidable, it is carried out only when strictly necessary for business or legal
      purposes, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Compliance with applicable laws and regulations, such as assisting law enforcement or supporting
        investigations conducted by governmental or regulatory authorities;</li>
      <li>Specific purposes related to our Services, which will be separately communicated to you where applicable; and

    <h2>Types of Data We Handle</h2>
    <p>In the course of providing our Services, StrongKeep may process various categories of data. Our approach is

      <li><strong>Business Contact Information:</strong> This includes information such as an individual's name, job
        title, business telephone number, business address, or business email address when used for professional
        purposes. In Singapore, business contact information is excluded from personal data regulation under data
        protection laws.</li>
      <li><strong>Anonymised Data:</strong> Data that has been processed to remove personal identifiers, making it
        impossible to identify an individual. Where possible, StrongKeep may use techniques such as pseudonymisation and
        masking to further reduce our exposure to personal identifiers.</li>
      <li><strong>Billing and Payment Information:</strong> Details such as credit or debit card numbers, bank account
        information, GIRO, or cheque details, which may be collected only when necessary to process transactions.</li>

        visited, time and date of visits, time spent on pages, and related usage statistics may be collected, as part of
        our Services to you.</li>
      <li><strong>Device Data:</strong> Information such as IP addresses, device identifiers, and system metadata and
        cybersecurity-related system information may be collected as part of our Services to you.</li>
      <li><strong>Publicly Available Information:</strong> Data accessible through public sources or observable at
        public events or locations. For reference, in Singapore, publicly available information is generally excluded
        from the scope of personal data protection laws.</li>
      <li><strong>Other Data:</strong> Any additional information you provide to us in the course of interacting with
        our Site or Services, including documents, text, or other materials relevant to your organization's

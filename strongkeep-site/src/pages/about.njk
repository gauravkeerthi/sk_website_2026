    <h1 class="animate-on-scroll">This is <small><i>our story.</i></small></h1>
    <p class="animate-on-scroll">We are reinventing how cybersecurity is delivered, to provide a cost-effective and
      scalable offering to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that meets their needs and safeguards their
      businesses from cyberattacks.</p>
    <p class="animate-on-scroll">The challenges faced by SMBs, including limited budgets and being unable to hire
      dedicated cybersecurity professionals, inspired us to bridge this gap.</p>

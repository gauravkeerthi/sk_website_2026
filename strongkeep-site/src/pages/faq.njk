      <summary>What is StrongKeep, and how is it different from hiring a cyber consultant?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Think of StrongKeep as your cyber bodyguard on subscription. Instead of paying consultants by the hour, you

  <!-- Compliance Plan Features -->

    <h2 class="faq-category-title">Compliance Plan Features</h2>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can StrongKeep help me get Cyber Essentials certification? How long does it take?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes! With StrongKeep, most companies complete Cyber Essentials in weeks, not months. The platform guides you
          step by step, and we handle the heavy lifting like policies and evidence collection so you're audit-ready
          fast.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Do I need to pay for certification or is it included?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>No extra fee for first-time customers. Your Cyber Essentials certification is included in the Compliance
          Plan. Once you complete the compliance process, we will send the documents to SETSCO, our certification
          partner. For renewals, the re-certification fee is not absorbed.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is StrongKeep adding on other types of certification standards?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>We are adding on Data Privacy Essentials certification and Healthcare Information Bill compliance. And that's
          just the start. More certifications will be added as regulations evolve, so you can grow your protection and
          proof without switching platforms.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What is the certification process like?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>StrongKeep walks you through it step by step—no guesswork, no piles of paperwork. First, choose your scope:
          just the required clauses, or optional extras for stronger protection. Then we auto-generate and pre-fill
          policies, templates, and documentation, showing you exactly where your input is needed and the documents you
          need to gather. Once done, StrongKeep packages everything and, with one click, submits it to our certification
          partner SETSCO. Simple, clear, and far quicker than doing it alone.</p>

  <!-- Protection Plan Features -->

    <h2 class="faq-category-title">Protection Plan Features</h2>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What exactly does StrongKeep protect me against?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>StrongKeep shields you from the big risks—ransomware, phishing emails, stolen passwords. You get training,
          firewalls, password manager, and endpoint protection all in one bundle.</p>
        <p>At the core, we use the same endpoint protection tools trusted by large enterprises. It spots ransomware and
          other sneaky attacks by watching how programmes behave, not just checking a list of "known threats". That
          means even brand-new attacks can be caught and stopped before they spread.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Do I need to monitor alerts constantly?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Only if you want to see what threats we blocked for you, but you don't have to. Let us do the hard work for
          you. In fact, we designed the solution to block threats for you without you having to intervene. We give you a
          dashboard to see what is under the hood, but if you would prefer not to look, that is perfectly ok as well. It
          will run in the background 24/7.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Will StrongKeep slow down my computers or network?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Not at all. Our tools are lightweight and designed to run quietly in the background. You won't even notice
          they're there.</p>
      </div>

  <!-- Subscription -->
  <div class="faq-category" id="subscription">
    <h2 class="faq-category-title">Subscription</h2>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is there an upfront fee or only subscription?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>No big scary upfront bill. Just one simple subscription that covers the platform, updates, and all the
          goodies inside.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can I pay monthly instead of annually?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes! Go monthly if you like flexibility or pick annual if you like saving money. Totally your call.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can I cancel anytime?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes, you can cancel at anytime. You will be able to enjoy the rest of the remaining time but you won't be
          charged at the next renewal.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What is the difference between the Protection Plan vs. Compliance Plan?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>The Protection Plan gives you a good foundation (firewall, backups, endpoint protection, and staff training)
          so your business is protected against everyday threats.</p>
        <p>The Compliance Plan builds on that by turning good security into provable security. Guided certifications,
          templates, and automated evidence tracking strengthen your policies and processes, closing the gaps hackers
          and regulators look for. And when you are certified, we make sure that we monitor and collect all the evidence
          you need for recertification.</p>

  <!-- Data Security & Privacy -->
  <div class="faq-category" id="data-security">
    <h2 class="faq-category-title">Data Security & Privacy</h2>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Where is my data stored?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>In secure, enterprise-grade cloud servers—based in Singapore or trusted global regions. Locked down and
          monitored.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What happens if I still get hacked while using StrongKeep?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>No platform can stop 100% of attacks. But StrongKeep reduces the risk, contains incidents, and keeps the
          evidence you need. If you suspect something, go through our cyber incident diagnostic tool. And with cyber
          insurance linked, you're covered to recover fast.</p>
